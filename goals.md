proficient in 
- C++
- operating systems
- Better understanding of real world Distributed Systems examples (via reading system papers for stuff like Raft)

Project ideas for practice
- The goal is to understand low level programming, and incorporate that with distributed systems. Work on creating a mock relational database, yes this is going to take like a billion months but will be good practice for all of the topics covered.
