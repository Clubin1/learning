## Basic Concepts
C++ code are essentially text files, header and source, that contain declerations and undergo translation to become an executable program. 

Keywords are special words in C++ that have a special meaning

Entities consist of,
-  values
-  objects
-  references
-  structured bindings
-  functions
-  enumerators
-  types
-  class members
-  templates
-  template specializations
-  parameter packs
-  name spaces

Declerations introduce entities, assign them values and define their properties

Declared objects and declared references that are non-static data members are variables
